# Biography

I am a PhD student in the Applied Mathematics department at the University of Washington. My research involves developing component-based reduced order models for parameter-dependent elliptic linear partial differential equations. My advisor is [Ulrich Hetmaniuk](http://www.hetmaniuk.net/).
