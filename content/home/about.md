# Biography

I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Applied Mathematics department at the University of Washington. My research involves sparsity-promoting regularization methods in neural networks and data-driven discovery of dynamical systems. I have also worked on developing component-based reduced order models for parameter-dependent elliptic linear partial differential equations. I am advised by [Nathan Kutz](http://faculty.washington.edu/kutz/).
